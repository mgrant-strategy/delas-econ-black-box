# Delas Econ Black Box

## 🎯 Overview
A behavioral economics and decision strategy lab built around real-world case studies. This repo explores how economic reasoning, incentives, and systems thinking can decode human behavior, institutional design, and media narratives.

Inspired by thinkers like Adam Smith, Martin Kilson, and Daniel Kahneman, this project blends:
- Real-world events
- Decision tree modeling
- LLM-augmented reasoning
- Strategic economic frameworks

## 🔍 Key Projects

### 🏈 Case Study 001 – Shedeur Sanders & NFL Draft Narrative
> Analyzes how media, market timing, and asymmetric incentives shaped the public narrative around Shedeur Sanders’ draft stock. Framed through behavioral economics and asset price manipulation analogies.

📎 *Features*: Decision tree model, strategic value framing, comparison to financial markets.

---

### 🏙️ Case Study 002 – Gentrification & Tax Incentives in Urban Redevelopment *(In Progress)*
> Dissects a tech company’s $500M tax break amid rising housing displacement, using economic revitalization narratives and local labor market data. Inspired by real patterns seen in areas like West Philadelphia and other urban zones.

📎 *Features*: Incentive structure breakdown, neighborhood data modeling, UPenn/West Philly parallel.

## ⚙️ Tools & Methods
- LLM-powered brainstorming and framing
- Decision Tree Mapping (Python or hand-drawn logic flows)
- Real-world economic data + narrative analysis
- Behavioral economics frameworks (loss aversion, signaling, bounded rationality)

## 💡 Why It Matters
Most economic decisions aren’t made in rational vacuums—they’re shaped by incentives, culture, and imperfect information. This repo shows how we can apply economics as a **lens, not a formula**, to decode the world’s complexity.

## 📈 Future Directions
- Add new case studies monthly (sports, politics, business)
- Integrate Jupyter notebooks for data visualization
- Launch a companion Medium series for longform storytelling

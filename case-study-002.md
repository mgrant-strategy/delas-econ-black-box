# Case Study 002 – Urban Redevelopment, Gentrification & the Incentive Illusion

## 🏙️ Title:
**"Revitalization or Extraction? Analyzing the Incentives Behind Urban Tech Development"**

## 📍 Context
A tech company secures a $500M+ tax incentive package to establish operations in a historically low-income neighborhood, promising economic revitalization, job creation, and infrastructure investment.

Within 18 months:
- Local Black homeownership drops by 12%
- Most new hires commute from other neighborhoods
- Median rent increases by 14%
- Small business turnover spikes

This case draws parallels to West Philadelphia’s transformation around the University of Pennsylvania, examining how institutional development often masks economic displacement.

## 🎯 Core Economic Question:
> Are “revitalization incentives” truly designed to benefit local communities—or are they strategic tools for asset acquisition, gentrification, and external capital extraction?

---

## 💡 Hypothesis
Tax breaks and corporate investment incentives **do not align** with the economic interests of legacy residents unless paired with enforceable local hiring, housing protection, and reinvestment mandates.

---

## 🔍 Analysis Breakdown

### 1. **Incentive Structure**
| Player | Incentive |
|--------|-----------|
| Tech Company | Maximize subsidy, enter undervalued real estate market, scale without tax burden |
| City Government | Show economic growth, attract high-paying jobs, compete with other cities |
| Local Residents | Maintain homeownership, access new opportunities, avoid displacement |

Result: The parties **appear aligned on paper**, but in reality, incentives are asymmetrical. Residents have **no enforceable stake**, only promises.

---

### 2. **Labor Market Analysis**
- Unchanged local unemployment rate = most new hires came from **outside** the community
- Skill mismatch remains unresolved
- Jobs were created, but not for the people originally promised

---

### 3. **Real Estate Dynamics**
- Rise in property tax assessments → homeowners cash out or get priced out
- Renters face rapid increases with no tenant protections
- Longtime residents leave → **new capital enters**

---

### 4. **LLM-Augmented Decision Tree**
A generative AI model was used to simulate possible policy interventions:
- Local hiring requirement? → Lower developer interest
- Rent control overlay? → Less gentrification, slower “revitalization”
- Equity share programs for residents? → Longer-term community wealth

## 📘 Theoretical Anchors
- **Information Asymmetry** (Freakonomics): Residents lack access to true developer intent
- **Asset Price Manipulation**: Similar to IPOs or undervalued stock narratives
- **Moral Hazard**: Developers bear no consequence for failing to deliver local benefit
- **Signaling Theory**: "Revitalization" language signals inclusivity while delivering exclusion

---

## 🔎 Reflections
> “It’s not that the city lied—it’s that the structure didn’t allow truth to matter.”

Revitalization isn’t just an economic outcome; it’s a **strategic narrative**—and one often used to justify short-term extraction rather than sustainable uplift.

---

## 📈 Future Expansion
- Incorporate local city council meeting notes and economic development contracts
- Create an LLM prompt chain to simulate stakeholder negotiations
- Compare outcomes from cities that implemented **resident equity programs**
